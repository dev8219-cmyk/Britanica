							<h1>Robots Through Time</h1>
							<p>The history of robots has its origins in the ancient world. During the Industrial Revolution, humans developed the structural engineering capability to control electricity so that machines could be powered with small motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a humanoid machine was developed.
							The first uses of modern robots were in factories as industrial robots. These industrial robots were fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less human work. Digitally programmed industrial robots with artificial intelligence have been built since the 2000s.
							</p>

							<h1>Early legends</h1>
							<p>The idea of artificial servants and companions dates back to ancient times and appears in many myths and legends across different cultures.</p>

							<p>In Ancient Greek mythology, stories describe artificial beings created by gods. One famous example is Cadmus, who planted dragon’s teeth that transformed into soldiers. Another is Pygmalion, whose statue Galatea was brought to life. The Greek god Hephaestus (known as Vulcan in Roman mythology) was said to have built golden mechanical maidens that could speak and assist him.</p>

							<p>In Asian traditions, similar ideas also appear. The Buddhist scholar Daoxuan (596–667 AD) wrote about metal humanoid figures that could recite sacred texts inside a monastery with a mechanical clock. According to legend, these “metal people” wept when Buddha Shakyamuni passed away. Humanoid automata are also mentioned in the Epic of King Gesar, a famous Central Asian story.</p>

							<p>Ancient Chinese literature includes references to mechanical creations as well. Legends about the carpenter Lu Ban and philosopher Mozi describe mechanical animals and demon-like machines. One of the most detailed stories appears in the Daoist text Liezi (4th century CE).</p>

							<p>In this story, King Mu of Zhou meets a craftsman named Yan Shi, who presents an artificial man that looks and behaves exactly like a human. The automaton could move, sing, and perform tricks. When it appeared to flirt with women at the royal court, the king became angry. To calm him, the craftsman opened the automaton and revealed its internal mechanical parts. Fascinated, the king tested how removing different components affected its behavior and wondered whether human skill could rival the Creator’s power.</p>

							<p>Similar stories appear in Indian Buddhist Jataka tales, although the machines described there are less advanced. These legends show that ancient thinkers were already questioning the difference between appearance and reality and exploring the limits of human creativity.

							<h2>Development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
							<p>The term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems capable of carrying out tasks perceived as requiring human intelligence.</p>
							<p>The most important development for automation and for robots in particular was the invention of the computer in the 20th century. When the transistor made tiny computers possible, they could be put in individual machine tools. Modern industrial robots arose from this linking of computer with machine.</p>
							<p>By means of a computer, a correctly designed machine tool can be programmed to perform more than one kind of task.</p>
							<p> If it is given a complex manipulator arm, its abilities can be enormously increased. The first such robot was designed by Victor Scheinman, a researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was followed in the mid-1970s by the production of so-called “programmable universal manipulators for assembly” (PUMAs) by General Motors and then by other manufacturers in the United States.</p>

									<h2>Robot Chef</h2>
									<p>One of the countries that has used the technologies of this new field most successfully is Japan. It has done so in part by making robot manipulators without trying to duplicate all of the motions of which the human arm and hand are capable. The robots are also easily reprogrammed and are therefore more adaptable to changing tasks on an assembly line.</p>

									<h2>Facial Recognition</h2>
									<p>Since the mid-20th century, computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks, such as playing chess and solving mathematical problems. Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider areas or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs can perform certain specific tasks as well as humans. AI in this limited sense is found in a variety of applications. These include, among others, medical diagnosis, voice or facial recognition, chatbots (computer programs designed to converse with humans), and virtual assistants (computer programs that help users perform various tasks).</p>

								<h2>Pulling Cart Robots</h2>

								<h3>1. What Are Pulling-Cart Robots?</h3>

								<p>
									A pulling-cart robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robot equipped with a mechanical coupling system that allows it to tow a cart or a train of carts. 
									Unlike pushing robots, which must drive behind or against a load, towing robots optimise energy use by pulling heavy objects with improved stability and manoeuvrability.
								</p>

								<p>
									These robots combine multiple advanced systems:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li><strong>Mobile Base:</strong> Typically differential-drive or omnidirectional, designed for strength, traction, and smooth movement.</li>
									<li><strong>Sensor Suite:</strong> Includes LIDAR, depth cameras, ultrasonic sensors, wheel encoders, and sometimes GPS for outdoor navigation.</li>
									<li><strong>Autonomous Navigation Software:</strong> Uses SLAM algorithms, obstacle avoidance systems, and intelligent path-planning modules.</li>
									<li><strong>Tow-Hitch or Coupling Mechanism:</strong> Mechanical arms, magnetic locks, or hook-and-pin systems that automatically attach to carts.</li>
									<li><strong>Safety Modules:</strong> Emergency stop buttons, human-detection systems, and speed limiters to ensure safe operation.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									These components enable pulling-cart robots to transport heavy loads safely and efficiently across industrial and commercial facilities, often without human assistance.
								</p>

								<h3>2. Why Pull Instead of Push?</h3>

								<p>
									Although pushing may seem simpler, pulling loads offers significant mechanical and operational advantages in many environments.
								</p>

								<h4>2.1 Better Stability at Higher Loads</h4>
								<p>
									When a robot pulls a cart, the centre of mass remains behind the drive wheels. This reduces the risk of tipping, particularly on slopes, ramps, or uneven surfaces.
								</p>

								<h4>2.2 Improved Manoeuvrability</h4>
								<p>
									Pulling allows the cart to naturally follow the robot’s path, making it easier to navigate tight corners and narrow spaces such as warehouse aisles, hospital corridors, or farm paths.
								</p>

								<h4>2.3 Lower Energy Consumption</h4>
								<p>
									Pulling generates less resistance on the drive system, allowing robots to conserve battery power while transporting loads over long distances.
								</p>

								<h4>2.4 Reduced Wear on Floors and Wheels</h4>
								<p>
									Smoother directional changes reduce stress on cart wheels, transport rails, and floor surfaces, resulting in lower maintenance costs and longer system lifespan.
